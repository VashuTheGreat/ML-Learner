The function should take a 2D NumPy array as input, where each row represents a data sample and each column represents a feature. It should return two 2D NumPy arrays: one scaled by standardization and one by min-max normalization. Make sure all results are rounded to the nearest 4th decimal.\n\n",

This includes algorithms that use distance measures like k-nearest neighbors and gradient descent-based algorithms like linear regression.\n\n**Standardization:**\nStandardization (or Z-score normalization) is the process where the features are rescaled so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one:\n\n$$ z = \\frac{(x - \\mu)}{\\sigma} $$\n\nwhere $x$ is the original feature, $\\mu$ is the mean of that feature, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation.\n\n**Min-Max Normalization:**\nMin-max normalization rescales the feature to a fixed range, typically 0 to 1, or it can be shifted to any range $[min, max]$ by transforming the data according to the formula:\n\n$$ x' = \\frac{(x - \\text{min}(x))}{(\\text{max}(x) - \\text{min}(x))} \\times (\\text{max} - \\text{min}) + \\text{min} $$\n\nwhere $x$ is the original value, $\\text{min}(x)$ is the minimum value for that feature, $\\text{max}(x)$ is the maximum value, and $\\text{min}$ and $\\text{max}$ are the new minimum and maximum values for the scaled data.\n\nImplementing these scaling techniques will ensure that the features contribute equally to the development of the model and improve the convergence speed of learning algorithms.\n\n",

The function then rounds the standardized and normalized data to the nearest 4th decimal place using the `np.round()` function and converts the resulting NumPy arrays to lists before returning them.\n\nThe NumPy implementation follows a similar approach but utilizes the built-in NumPy functions `np.mean()`, `np.std()`, `np.min()`, and `np.max()` to perform the feature scaling operations. This version is more concise and potentially more efficient, especially for larger datasets, as it leverages NumPy's optimized array operations.\n\nBoth implementations produce the same result, but the NumPy version may be preferred in scenarios where performance is critical or when working with larger datasets that are already in NumPy array format.\n",
