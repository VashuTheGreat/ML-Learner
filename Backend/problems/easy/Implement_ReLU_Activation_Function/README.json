This elegantly captures the ReLU function's behavior: returning 0 for negative inputs and the input itself for positive values.\n\n2. **NumPy Implementation**:\n   The NumPy implementation uses the `np.maximum()` function, which performs element-wise maximum comparison between two arrays or values. In this case, it compares 0 and the input `z`, effectively implementing the ReLU function.\n\nBoth implementations achieve the same result, but the NumPy version might be more efficient for large-scale operations or when working with arrays of data. The custom implementation is straightforward and doesn't require additional libraries, making it suitable for simpler applications or when NumPy is not available.\n\nThe `relu()` function is typed with Python's type hints, indicating that it takes a float as input and returns a float. This enhances code readability and can help catch type-related errors early in development.\n",
