For a more robust solution that works with multidimensional inputs, `np.inner()` is recommended.\n\nWhen dealing with 2D arrays or matrices, `np.inner()` computes the inner product of vectors for the last dimension of `x1` and `x2`. This makes it more flexible and suitable for a wider range of input types.\n\n",
