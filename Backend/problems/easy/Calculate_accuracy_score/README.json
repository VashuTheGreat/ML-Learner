It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. Mathematically, accuracy is given by:\n\n$$\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\\text{Total Number of Predictions}}$$\n\nIn this problem, you will write a function to calculate the accuracy score given the true labels and the predicted labels. The function will compare the two arrays and compute the accuracy as the proportion of matching elements.\n\nAccuracy is a straightforward and commonly used metric for classification tasks. It provides a quick way to understand how well a model is performing, but it may not always be the best metric, especially for imbalanced datasets.\n\n",
